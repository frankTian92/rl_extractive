0: anything still happen quake-stricken fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant japan experts hopeful situation stabilize
1: best-case scenario electrical power cooling would restored six units plant said tom kauffman spokesman nuclear energy institute policy organization nuclear energy technologies industry washington
2: restoring electric power essential stabilizing plant said michael golay professor nuclear science engineering massachusetts institute technology
3: power would ensure water provided cover fuel
4: workers hope install crucial panel annex building severely affected last friday post-earthquake tsunami new power supply system finished friday morning official tokyo power company said friday morning
5: improvised power system using 1.5 kilometers total cable expected provide electricity power cooling systems nos. 1 2 reactors plant
6: also engineers got emergency diesel generator unit 6 running supplying power units 5 6 japan nuclear industrial safety agency said friday
7: water injection spent fuel pool continuing
8: obviously hoping bring various cooling problems control near future said ian hutchinson professor nuclear science engineering massachusetts institute technology
9: fuel rods submerged water large releases radioactive materials come end hutchinson said
10: cooling water restored spent fuel pools reactor cooling flooding maintained expectations stabilization situation major reduction radiation emissions said
11: able say got control hutchinson said
12: control week two things may stabilize
13: whole cleanup would take matter months even years hutchinson said
14: site wo usable said gary professor department materials science engineering university michigan
15: even best case scenario melted fuel reactor going usable said
16: real concern after-heat arising fuel rods need water cooling hutchinson said
17: unless much bigger releases contaminations near site people may one day able safely get closer fukushima daiichi current established evacuation zones golay said
18: united states government instructed americans stay 50 miles plant japanese citizens evacuation zone 12 miles
19: fact differing policies mean u.s. thinks dangerous golay said
20: simply u.s. position help citizens japan said
21: situation fukushima daiichi worse three mile island pennsylvania plant suffered partial core meltdown one reactors 1979 golay said
22: fukushima daiichi radioactive material involved less contained said
23: chernobyl disaster world worst nuclear power plant accident occurred 1986 facility sealed large concrete sarcophagus
24: hard say whether need happen fukushima daiichi experts say
25: depends extent contamination unknown said
26: sealing three mile island also discussed time disaster kauffman said instead reactor cleaned damaged fuel core debris shipped off-site put storage
27: still wait-and-see mode kauffman said
