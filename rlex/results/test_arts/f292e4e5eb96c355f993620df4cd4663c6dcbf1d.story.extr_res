0: new space race officially way one sci-fi geeks salivating
1: lift space nasa interpretation space elevator may look like
2: project space elevator experts believe concept well within bounds possibility maybe even within lifetimes
3: conference discussing developments space elevator concepts held japan november hundreds engineers scientists asia europe americas working design lift take directly one hundred-thousandth floor
4: despite developments could excused thinking sounds little far-fetched
5: indeed successfully built space elevator would unprecedented feat human engineering
6: cable anchored earth surface reaching tens thousands kilometers space balanced counterweight attached end basic design elevator
7: thought inertia physics theory stating matter retains velocity along straight line long acted upon external force cause cable stay stretched taut allowing elevator sit geostationary orbit
8: cable would extend sky eventually reaching satellite docking station orbiting space
9: engineers hope elevator transport people objects space even suggestions could used dispose nuclear waste
10: another proposed idea use elevator place solar panels space provide power homes earth
11: sounds like stuff fiction maybe
12: 1979 arthur c. clarke novel fountains paradise brought idea space elevator mass audience
13: charles sheffield web worlds also featured building space elevator
14: jump storybooks fast-forward nearly three decades japanese scientists japan space elevator association working seriously space-elevator project
15: association spokesman akira tsuchida said organization working u.s.-based spaceward foundation european organization based luxembourg develop elevator design
16: liftport group u.s. also working developing design total believed 300 scientists engineers engaged work around globe
17: nasa holding 4 million space elevator challenge encourage designs successful space elevator
18: tsuchida said technology driving race build first space elevator quickly developing material carbon nanotube
19: lightweight tensile strength 180 times stronger steel cable
20: currently material potential strong enough use manufacture elevator cable according tsuchida
21: present tether made carbon nanotube one-third one-quarter strength required make space elevator
22: expect strong enough cable 2020s 2030s tsuchida said
23: said likely method powering elevator would carbon nanotube cable
24: major logistical issues keeping space elevator anything dream present
25: massachusetts institute technology aeronautics astronautics professor jeff hoffman said designing carbon nanotube appeared biggest obstacle
26: verge material strength span 30,000 km ability make long cable carbon nanotubes moment
27: although confident within reasonable amount time able
28: tsuchida said one biggest challenges acquiring funding move projects forward
29: present financial backing space elevator project japanese group 100-plus members maintain jobs earn living
30: material enough strength construct space elevator yet difficult change people mind believe real said
31: hoffman feels international dialogue needs encouaraged issue
32: said number legal considerations also would taken account
33: something one nation one company
34: needs worldwide approach said
35: difficulties space-elevator projects include build base elevator design set operation
36: tsuchida said possible locations elevator include south china sea western australia galapagos islands pacific ocean
37: said locations usually avoided typhoons could pose threat safety elevator
38: base space elevator located geosynchronous orbit -lsb- -rsb- space elevator ground station located near equator said
39: although japanese association set time frame 2030s get space elevator construction developments moving quickly hoffman acknowledges could little away
40: know going lifetime 100 200 years away near enough contemplate work
41: building space elevator matter said hoffman believes herald major new period human history
42: revolutionary human technology space travel
43: many people pursuing said
44: take turn humans space-bearing species
